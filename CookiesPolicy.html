                    <h2>Does LinkedIn Use Cookies?</h2>
    
                    <p>As described in Section 1.8 of our
                    <a href="#"> Privacy Policy</a>
                    , LinkedIn uses cookies and similar technologies like pixels and tags to 
                    ensure that we give you the best possible experience on our website.</p>

                    <p>A cookie is a small file placed onto your device. 
                    Cookies enable us to identify your device, and enable the 
                    functioning of many LinkedIn features, including your ability to log 
                    into your account.</p>

                    <p>If you don't want to receive cookies, you can change your browser 
                    settings. If you use LinkedIn without changing your browser settings,
                     we'll assume that you're happy to receive all cookies on the LinkedIn
                     website. Please note that the LinkedIn site will not work properly 
                     without cookies.</p>

                     <p>Trusted partners like 
                     <a href="#">DoubleClick </a>,<a href="#">BlueKai </a> , and 
                     <a href=# > Lotame </a> help us serve advertising on and off the 
                     LinkedIn site, and analytics companies like 
                     Google Analytics, Quantcast, Nielsen, and ComScore, 
                     may also place cookies on your machine. Please read their 
                     privacy policies to ensure that you’re comfortable with the 
                     manner in which they use cookies.</p>

                     <h2>What types of cookies does LinkedIn Use?</h2>
                     <p>LinkedIn uses two types of cookies, persistent and session.
                     A persistent cookie is set once you've logged in to your LinkedIn
                     account. The next time you visit the LinkedIn website using the
                     same device, the persistent cookie will enable us to recognize
                     you as an existing user, so you may not need to log in before using 
                     our services.</p>
 
                     <p>

                    A session cookie is used to identify a particular visit to the 
                    LinkedIn website. Session cookies expire after a short time, 
                    or when you close your web browser.</p>

                    <p>Other technology, such as Adobe Flash, can be used to place the
                     functional equivalent of a cookie on your computer. </p>
 
                     <h2>When does LinkedIn put cookies on my device? </h2>
                     <p>Cookies may be set by LinkedIn when you visit linkedin.com,
                     or they may be set by other websites or services who run content
                     on the page you're viewing (known as third-party cookies).</p>
 
                     <p>You can also learn more about LinkedIn’s advertising practices
                     by reading our <a href=#> Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
 
                     <h2>What are cookies used for?</h2>
                     <p>Cookies can be used to do lots of different things, 
                     like recognize you when you navigate to LinkedIn's site, 
                     storing your preferences and improving your experience. 
                     Cookies also make your interactions with LinkedIn more secure,
                     faster, and help us ensure that your LinkedIn experience is 
                     personalized to you and in line with your settings. Additionally, 
                     cookies allow LinkedIn to bring you advertising both on and off the 
                     LinkedIn site, and bring customized features to you through LinkedIn
                     plugins such as our share button. </p>
 
                     <p>LinkedIn uses cookies for a number of purposes, including: </p>
                     <p> <span class="h3"> Authentication </span>
                    - LinkedIn uses cookies to recognize you if you are logged in to
                     LinkedIn, so that we can show you the right information and 
                     personalize your experience.
                     </p>
                     <p><span class="h3">Security </span>- LinkedIn uses cookies to support or enable security features
                     we have deployed, and to help us detect malicious activity and 
                     violations of our User Agreement.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                     <span class="h3">Preferences, features and services </span> - LinkedIn uses cookies to know which language you prefer, 
                    what your communications preferences are, and they help you 
                    fill out forms on LinkedIn. Plus they provide you with features,
                     insights, and customized content through our plugins.
                     </p>
                    <p>
                    <span class="h3">Advertising</span> - LinkedIn may use cookies to show you relevant advertising both on
                     and off the LinkedIn site. We may also use a cookie to learn whether
                     members who saw an ad on LinkedIn later visited the advertiser’s site.
                     Similarly, our partners may use a cookie to determine whether we’ve 
                     shown an ad and how it performed, or provide us with information about 
                     how you interact with them. We may also work with a partner to show
                     you an ad on or off LinkedIn, such as after you’ve visited a partner’s
                     site or application. Cookies and ad technology such as web beacons,
                     pixels, and anonymous ad network tags help LinkedIn more effectively
                     serve ads to you, as well as to collect aggregated auditing, research,
                     and reporting for advertisers. Note: Because your web browser may
                     request advertisements and web beacons directly from ad network servers,
                     these networks can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you
                     had requested a web page from their site.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                    <span class="h3">Performance, Analytics and Research</span> - LinkedIn uses cookies to help us learn how well our site and
                     plugins perform across the globe. We also use cookies to understand,
                     improve, and research products, features, and services, including when
                     you access LinkedIn from other websites, applications, or devices
                     such as your work computer or your mobile device.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their 
                    settings preferences. Limiting the ability of websites to set cookies,
                     however, may worsen your overall user experience.
